This repository stores the code for Project Two of Product Design. Project Two is to create a product mission statement, create user stories, and develop an MVP product.

## Product Mission Statement

Our mission is to connect users with the vibrant culture of street vendors by providing a seamless and intuitive platform powered by the Google Maps API. We aim to empower users to effortlessly locate and enjoy authentic street food experiences, fostering a sense of community and discovery within the bustling and diverse culinary landscape of cities worldwide.
